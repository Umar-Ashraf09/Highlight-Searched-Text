            Sunlight dappled through leaves, painting the park bench gold. She unfurled the worn paperback, its spine cracked like a
            weathered map. Today, fingers itched to explore fiction's verdant landscapes. But comfort, a siren in dusty prose,
            called her back. Same bench, same book, another chapter in routine's predictable sunlit story.
